# Character Tracker

Originally built for a dnd campaign, this app can be used to keep track of characters and monsters during a session. Spectator mode is designed to run on a screen that every player can see. Each session is represented by a "room" which players can join. All character and monster data updates in real time. The room owner can assign control of characters or monsters to any player present in the room. **This app is in a beta state, expect bugs üòÅ**

This app is built with Docker, so one command is all it takes.
